# Weather Dashboard ☀️☁️❄️

Welcome to the **Weather Dashboard** repository! 🌟 This Python-based web application, built using the **Flask/Django** framework, provides users with real-time weather updates for any city. Powered by a weather API, it displays essential details like temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions. Plus, it includes a **saving feature** for storing your favorite locations and their weather data!
